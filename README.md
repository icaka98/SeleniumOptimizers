<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

WhySoSlow is a mixture of several subprojects that tackle different problems. The main focus of this solutions is to optimize and/or automize specific tasks that would usually take tremendous effort or occupy significant amount of time. WhySoSlow currently incorporates the following projects:

1. Gmail Notifier - Have you ever waited for a specific email to arrive? Maybe from a company/university that you applied to or any other organization/person that you're desperate to hear from? Usually, after spending considerable time in the settings of your email provider, one can set it so that the email app on the smart phone only triggers a notification if that long-waited email arrives. But what if you want to trigger another event (turning the lamp on, playing a dramatic sound, etc.)? This module looks for a specificly described recently received email and allows triggering any other services from there via bluetooth or the Internet. 

2. Jobs BG Scraper - If you've ever looked for a job in Sofia, Bulgaria, chances are you looked at the jobs.bg website. It allows for a very complex search - location, type, data of publication, language requirements, etc. However, certain functionalities are missing for the casual visitor - statistics for the current job offerings, sorting by a particular parameter, etc. This module focuses on implementing a GUI that outlines the current salary characteristics for the IT sector in Bulgaria and is modifiable for other such cases.

3. The Batch Newspaper - The deeplearning.ai company decided to run a weekly blog that outlines the "cool" researches published or shared during the previous week. I found that newsletter incredibly valuable. Still, I'm more of the 'real books have curves' type of person. Therefore, I prefer to read the newspaper on real paper. Unfortunately, deeplearning.ai would not allow download in pdf format (that I could possibly print). This module solves the problem - it scrapes the blog from each week and creates a pdf version of the blog that one could then download and print. Of course, the use case of this subproject is applicable to other similar scenarios.
